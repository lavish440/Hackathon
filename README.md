# Problem Statement

_Problem: 56_

**Developing a GUI based hardening script for Ubuntu operating system with flexibility to cater for organisational security policies**

## Ideas

- We have developed a Bash script based on a NCURSES like library
- User can easily select the security options that he wants to add to his system
- The options can easily be removed and added
- Frontend using C++ QT, Python PyQT5 or tkinter can be added
- A front end website can also be implemented
